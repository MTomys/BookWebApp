# Description
Just a simple Book CRUD application for practice purposes

Back end - 
It will utilize LINQ, Entity framework (with sql server) and rest controllers 
to serve the objects to Front-end

Front end - 
Here I will utilize React together with Typescript and some CSS library for serving the content to the user.

Functionality - 
This page will be able to display Books and their Authors, manage the Books and Author state
(either adding new, removing existing ones or updating current entities)
